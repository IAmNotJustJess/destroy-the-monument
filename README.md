# **Destroy the Monument** - *A Team-Based, Class-Based, Player versus Player Minecraft Minigame*

## (Relatively) Short explanation
Destroy the Monument is a new iteration of a classic mini-game, once popular on (now defunct) McLobby server.
This plugin extends the original by adding an in-game per arena economy, that allows players to further increase their power with playtime.\
\
Each player will be able to choose a class from a list of available ones.\
Each class has a different ability set, loadout and upgrade tree.\
For doing game objectives, players earn Shards (currency) which they can spend on upgrading themselves.
A game consists of two teams full of players, each team has a certain amount of players.\
\
Both of those teams have the same amount of monuments placed around (set as obsidian blocks).\
A team that breaks all of their opponent's monuments wins, otherwise when the time runs out, the team with most standing monuments wins.
A game lasts 60 minutes (by default).

## Mechanics:

### Player Classes:

They consist of:
- A name (duh!);
- A description;
- A loadout (item kit);
- A passive skill;
- An active skill;
- An ultimate skill;
- An upgrade tree.

### Shards:

Shards are in-game currency, used for upgrading kits. They allow players to increase the power of their abilities
or add new ones to their skill set.\
\
Shards are awarded for doing certain objectives, by default they look somewhat like this:
- Per minute: +2 (Stacking - with every 10 minutes adds another 2);
- Per kill: +50;
- Per assist: +10;
- Per monument broken: +(1500 / amount of monuments on the arena);

### Win condition:

There are two ways to win the game:
- Breaking all the enemy monuments;
- Having more of them standing at the point of time running out.

If both teams have the same amount of monuments standing, it's a tie.
